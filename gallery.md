New mechanic: **Load out**.

1. Load out represents two activated abilities. Load out [cost] means “[Cost]: Attach this permanent to another target creature your team controls. Activate only as a sorcery” and “[Cost]: Unattach this permanent. Activate only if this permanent is attached to a creature and only as a sorcery.”
2. Attaching an Equipment with load out to another creature causes the Equipment to stop being a creature until it becomes unattached from that creature.

## Friend or Foe rares

This is a cycle of Meld sagas. At common, there's a bottom-half with chapter III which is the same for all 5 characters. Each of the characters is a unique top-half with a name and chapters I/II.

It's not at all clear if these effects or creative treatments are the best. They're a good start, though.
