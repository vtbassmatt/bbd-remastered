# Battlebond Remastered

A fan-created Magic: the Gathering set remastering [Battlebond](https://mtg.wiki/page/Battlebond).

## Goals

Two-Headed Giant draft was fun, but apparently Battlebond didn't sell well. This set imagines that WotC wants to try again with a Play Booster structure but spend minimal resources on design and playtesting.

## Structure

- 81 commons
- 100 uncommons
- 53 rares
- 15 rares

This set cuts 20 commons and adds 20 uncommons to imitate the Play Booster default set numbers. Pack collation would be 7 commons, 3 uncommons, 1 rare/mythic, 2 wildcards of any rarity, and a basic land if this were a retail set. For homebrew draft, I would replace the basic land with another uncommon slot. There is no The List or Special Guest list for this set (yet?).

## Remaster

The original [Battlebond card list](battlebond_cards.csv) had some weak spots.

### Removals

20 commons [had to go](cut_cards.csv) or [be upgraded](remastered_cards.csv):
- One vanilla per color cut
- The five least interesting colorless creatures cut
- Two commons per color upgraded

Also, the rare Friend or Foe sorceries may not be optimal for 2HG.

### Additions

The cut common slots were shifted to uncommon and [replaced](new_cards.csv).

- The vanilla creatures are replaced by a new cycle of equipment creatures modeled after the Reconfigure cards in Neon Dynasty. They use a mechanic called "Load out", which is Reconfigure but you can attach them to creatures your team controls.
- The colorless creatures were replaced with various role-fillers both canon and non-canon.
- The rest of the cut commons were upgraded to be more interesting.

Also, the Friend or Foe sorceries were replaced with `TODO`.
