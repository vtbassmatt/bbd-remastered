# Upgrades

## White

- Angelic Gift -> something more impactful than a cantrip flying aura
  - Eidolon of Angels: used Bestow to keep an Aura spell in that slot
- Silverchase Fox -> artifact/enchantment destruction
  - Yellow Card -> moved 2/2 for 2 into Eidolon slot, so making this a pure instant

## Blue

- Kitesail Corsair -> Welkin Tern or better
  - Canon "Zephyr Winder" is strictly better
- Totally Lost -> similar but with Assist
  - Not totally happy with a 3UU cost and yet-another Assist card

## Black

- Eyeblight Assassin -> something more exciting
  - Stern Referee does some counter/anti-counter shenanigans
- Liturgy of Blood -> Annihilating Glare (or Fell)
  - Annihilating Glare it is

## Red

- Bathe in Dragonfire -> any target, or something with Surge
  - Shower with Dragonfire - bumped up base cost but gave it Surge
- Stadium Vendors -> give a rummage and mana
  - Premium Vendors is a simple upgrade

## Green

- Fertile Ground -> something more exciting
  - Downshift canon Mana Bloom to uncommon
- Kraul Warrior -> team can help pay the cost
  - Kraul Brawler is a simple upgrade
