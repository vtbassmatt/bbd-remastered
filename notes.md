# Upgrades

## White

- Angelic Gift -> something more impactful than a cantrip flying aura
  - Eidolon of Angels: used Bestow to keep an Aura spell in that slot
- Silverchase Fox -> artifact/enchantment destruction
  - Yellow Card -> moved 2/2 for 2 into Eidolon slot, so making this a pure instant

## Blue

- Kitesail Corsair -> Welkin Tern or better
  - Canon "Zephyr Winder" is strictly better
- Totally Lost -> similar but with Assist
  - Not totally happy with a 3UU cost and yet-another Assist card

## Black

- Eyeblight Assassin -> something more exciting
  - Stern Referee does some counter/anti-counter shenanigans
- Liturgy of Blood -> Annihilating Glare (or Fell)
  - Annihilating Glare it is

## Red

- Bathe in Dragonfire -> any target, or something with Surge
  - Shower with Dragonfire - bumped up base cost but gave it Surge
- Stadium Vendors -> give a rummage and mana
  - Premium Vendors is a simple upgrade

## Green

- Fertile Ground -> something more exciting
  - Downshift canon Mana Bloom to uncommon
- Kraul Warrior -> team can help pay the cost
  - Kraul Brawler is a simple upgrade

# Additions

- A new cycle of Reconfigure-like equipment creatures. These can be attached to your teammate. They replace the cut common vanilla creatures.
- Colorless slots moved from common to uncommon:
  - 2/2 for 2: Ticket Tortoise (canon) 3/1 land catchup
  - 3/1 for 3: Copper Squire, an upgrade from Brass Squire, as a 2/2 equipper
  - 1/4 for 3: Unexpected Powerup converts Atraxa's Skitterfang into a 3-use instant (once from hand, then from exile with Rebound, then from the graveyard with Flashback)
  - 4/4 for 5: Referee's Call uses the "friend or foe" mechanic to mass-kill small creatures, and in a 2HG game still leaves you with bodies worth 4/4
  - 5/7 for 7: Mechanical Official - if you choose to support no other creatures, it remains a 5/7 for 7, but you can support up to 4 creatures instead
